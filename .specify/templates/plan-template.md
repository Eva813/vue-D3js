# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript with Vue 3 (Composition API + `<script setup>`)
**Primary Dependencies**: Vue 3, D3 v7+, Vite, Vitest, Vue Test Utils
**Testing Framework**: Vitest (unit), Vue Test Utils (components), Lighthouse CI (performance)
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (ES2020+); responsive design required
**Project Type**: Single web application with component library
**Performance Goals**: 60fps component renders (<16ms), D3 transitions <1000ms, page load <2s (4G), bundle gzip <50KB per feature
**Constraints**: TypeScript strict mode required, 80% test coverage minimum, WCAG AA accessibility minimum, <2s Time to Interactive
**Scale/Scope**: Vue components with D3 visualizations; design system with reusable patterns; accessibility priority

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
